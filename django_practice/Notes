first : in the views.py we import any modes we will nedd to display
second : use the view to query the models for data that will need .
third: pass results to the models templattes
fourth: edit the template so that it is ready to accept and display
fifth: map url to the view 


template tagging : using {{}}  {% %}

----forms------

GET req data from resource
POST submit data to processed


---------authentication-----------
use pbkdf algorithm using sha256 hash to hash password which is built in django algo
decrypt library aswell
in settings.py Auth_password_validator we can have validators like must use nums and alphabet 
min letters etc 

install library for hashing
pip install django[argon2]
pip install bcrypt 

in settings.py:
PASSWORD_HASHERS=[
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BcryptSHA256PasswordHasher'
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BcryptPasswordHasher'
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher'
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDFSHA1PasswordHasher'
]

add TEMPLATE_DIR, in dirs[]

TEMPLATE_DIR=os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')
STATIC_DIR
MEDIA_DIR

to work with images(save images) we need a library called pillow (pip install pillow)




For anyone who finds the folder structure confusing:
I usually create a base folder, for example MyWebsite.
Then I cd into that folder and run:
django-admin startproject config .
This creates a config folder containing the settings, and initializes the Django project directly inside MyWebsite.
 
So instead of getting MyWebsite/MyWebsite
you get MyWebsite/config




------------------------------------------------------project flow-------------------------------------------

-create project
-cd to project
-create app 
-add the app in installed apps in settings.py
-do makemigrations and migrate 
-create templates/appname, static , media folders 
-html pages in templates, js and css in static, images in media 
-create urls.py in app folder
-if templates,static and media are in the project dir the add this stuff in settings .py if its in the app dir then no need
add TEMPLATE_DIR, in dirs[]

TEMPLATE_DIR=os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')
STATIC_DIR
MEDIA_DIR

-do tempalate tagging and write code fr pages
-in order to use the inbuilt user table which has username,ps, firstname,last name we import (from django.contrib.auth.models import User) in models 
-in forms.py have 2 classes -one for user inbuilt data and one for extra data
