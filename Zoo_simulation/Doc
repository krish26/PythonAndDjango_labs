Impemented base class Animal()->name,age,energy attr-> sleep() eat() interact() methods
Carnivour module witch has 3 child class (Lion,Wolf,Eagle)
herbivour module with 3 child classes (Elephant,Deer,Giraffe)
visitor classwith animal interaction method, feeding()
Main() module for simulation of a day in the zoo with morning feeding, 
afternoon interaction, night sleeping
done -implement animal energy levels affecting their behavior and maybe some warnings if the energy is low 







#todo:
Figure out how to make animal interaction more dynamic and interesting
animal interaction effecting them like maybe a chance of injury ? so animal_healh() method 
checke duplicated logic 
encapsulation and resue 
predator prey system fo extension 

SEPERATE SIMULATION LOGIC FROM EXECUTION LOGIC 

maybe clean up the output formatting for better readability

making each animal a dictonary so we can add more animals of same type easily , like user input??

like add new animal :enter which animal you want to add and ask their names and ages and put in that dictonary

find better way to show simulation of a day in zoo
